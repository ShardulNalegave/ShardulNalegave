What you are seeing right now is my own Knowledge-Base or as some people like to call it, my "Second Brain". I use this to note everything down be it technical or non-technical.

## How does this work?
This is a TiddlyWiki5 file that is customised to my liking, you can search for notes using the search-bar or just explore related notes using their backlinks.
