  <meta property="og:description" content="Hello! Iâ€™m Shardul Nalegave, a second-year Computer Engineering student at PICT, Pune, with an insatiable curiosity for how technology works, right down to the fundamental layers. My journey started back in 6th grade with simple game programming, and that initial spark has grown into a deep passion for Systems and Networking Development. I love the challenge of designing, building, and optimizing the core infrastructure that powers our digital world.
My primary focus is on crafting robust networking protocols and distributed systems. I dive deep into specifications (like the various RFCs for DNS) to build tools like Drasil-DNS, a Rust-based library aiming to be part of a larger, self-hostable DNS resolver. I also enjoy exploring the intricacies of operating systems, which led me to create Catalyst-OS, a learning project built from scratch in Rust.">

<p>While systems are my core interest, I believe in broad exploration. You&rsquo;ll find projects in my portfolio spanning Full-Stack web development (using stacks like MERN) and even AI-powered tools like Lucerna, which transforms research papers into audio podcasts using self-hosted models. I thrive on learning new technologies and applying them to solve interesting problems.</p>
<p>Feel free to explore my projects, check out my code on GitHub, or reach out if you&rsquo;d like to discuss technology, potential collaborations, or exciting opportunities!</p>
