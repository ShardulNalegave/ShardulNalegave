Conway's Game of Life in Rust

**Github:** https://github.com/ShardulNalegave/conway

Game of Life or simply life is a zero-player game devised by British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. The functioning of the game depends only on its initial state and is governed by very simple rules.

Conway's Game of Life is Turing complete, it's halting problem is whether a given initial configuration becomes stable after n generations or if it keeps evolving.
