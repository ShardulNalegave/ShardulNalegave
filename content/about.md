Hello! I'm Shardul Nalegave, a third-year Computer Engineering student at PICT, Pune. My journey into the world of Comp-Sci started back in 6th grade with simple game programming and a robotics lab and that initial spark has grown into a deep passion for understanding how technology works down to the fundamental layers.

While Systems and Networks are my core interest, I believe in broad exploration. You'll find projects in my portfolio spanning Distributed Systems, Embedded Systems, Full-Stack Development, etc. I love learning new tech and applying them to solve interesting problems.

Feel free to explore my projects, check out my code on GitHub, or reach out if you'd like to discuss technology, potential collaborations, or exciting opportunities!
